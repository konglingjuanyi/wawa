/**
 * Extension of FutureTask that provides slightly different cancel()
 * behavior.  We want cancel() to only return true if the task has not yet run.
 *
 * Multi-threaded scenario 1:
 * run() invoked in T1
 * The task hasn't been cancelled, so runCalled is set
 * to true.  This happens in a synchronized block so cancel() cannot
 * execute while the flag is being set.  Once we enter the synchronized
 * block and get past the cancelled check we are guaranteed to run, and
 * if cancel() is invoked at any point afterwards runCalled will be true, so
 * cancel() will be unable to return anything other than false, which is what
 * we want.
 *
 * Multi-threaded scenario 2:
 * cancel() invoked in T1
 * The method is synchronized, so even if T2 invokes run() it won't be able to
 * enter the synchronized block until cancel() finishes executing.
 * The cancelled flag is set to true, so we return right away.
 * cancel() returns the result of super.cancel() because runCalled is guaranteed to be false.
 *
